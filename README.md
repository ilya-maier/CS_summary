# What is it
This is my personal repo with all computer science related infos such as 
algorithms, data structures, related topics and articles and the like.

This repo is intended to help all of the other students/developers who want
to look up information about a specific algorithm/data structure and look at a
simple implementation in Python. Hope it helps you :)

# Table of contents
So far this repo includes:
- Sorting algorithms
    - Bubble sort
    - Insertion sort
